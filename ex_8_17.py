# Write a function that implements a substitution cipher.
# In a substitution cipher one letter is substituted for another
# to garble the message. For example A -> Q, B -> T, C -> G etc.
# your function should take two parameters, the message you want
# to encrypt, and a string that represents the mapping of the 26
# letters in the alphabet. Your function should return a string
# that is the encrypted version of the message.
